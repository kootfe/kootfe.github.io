        <article class="blog-content">
            <p>Hello there.</p>

            <p>Today, we are diving into the world of <strong>Networking</strong>. A friend of mine is getting into DevOps and asked for help, so I’m making this series for him—and for you! If you hate DevOps... well, you can keep hating it. I do too. LOL. But you still gotta learn it!</p>

            <p>In this series, we’re covering everything from IP addresses to WebSockets and custom protocols. Let’s roll!</p>

            <p>When people talk about networking, two things usually come up: <strong>IP</strong> and <strong>Port</strong>. (And MAC addresses if you’re a weirdo, but let’s skip that for now).</p>

            <p>Think of an <strong>IP Address</strong> like a building's street address. If I send data to <code>1.1.1.1</code>, that’s your house!</p>

            <p>But wait... because of how the modern world works, we aren’t living in single-family houses. We’re living in <strong>apartments</strong>. If the IP is the building address, the <strong>Port</strong> is the apartment number. Every transport protocol—yeah there are protocols of the internet that don’t carry data but do other things—has <strong>65,536</strong> available ports. So, if I send data to <code>1.1.1.1:8080</code>, I’m sending a package to Building 1.1.1.1, Apartment 8080. Simple, right?</p>

            <p>Wait, I said <code>1.1.1.1</code>, but you might see <code>abcd:abcd:abcd:abcd:abcd:abcd:abcd:abcd</code>... or just <code>abcd::</code>. Congrats, you’ve found <strong>IPv6</strong>.</p>

            <p>Why does it exist? Not because IPv4 sucks, but because we ran out of them. However, most DevOps and IT people hate IPv6. A wise IT guy once said: <em>"If your client wants you to set up IPv6 and TLS, just cut the Ethernet cable to enable the firewall."</em></p>

            <p>It works perfectly fine with TLS—it genuinely doesn't care—but it’s a total pain in the ass to debug. IPv4 is exhausted; we literally cannot give new IPv4 addresses to everyone. That’s why things like <strong>NAT</strong> exist. IPv6 is massive and designed to work without NAT. Using NAT with IPv6 is like inventing a car to go faster but hitching a horse to the front of it. It kills the purpose!</p>

            <h2>Neighborhoods: WAN vs. LAN</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> The Internet. Google, YouTube, and that weird forum you visit at 3 AM? That’s all WAN.</li>
                <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Your private 'inner circle.' The network inside your house managed by your router. You don’t even need the internet to have a LAN; two computers can talk via a cable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Loopback</h2>
            <p><strong>Loopback (<code>127.0.0.1</code>)</strong>: This is 'Home.' Data sent here never leaves your computer. It’s like talking to yourself in the mirror—you shout, you hear it, nobody else can. (Fun fact: the whole <code>127.x.x.x</code> range, more than 16 million IPs, is reserved for this.)</p>

            <h2>NAT: The Gatekeeper</h2>
            <p>IPv4 addresses are running out. NAT is the 'gatekeeper' that lets an entire household share <strong>one single Public IP</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Private IPs (<code>192.168.x.x</code>)</strong>: These are the addresses your router gives out. Your phone might be <code>192.168.1.5</code> and your PC <code>192.168.1.10</code>. These are invisible to the outside world. More like… it never even leaves their router if they send a request. But that’s up to them, not you.</p>

            <p><strong>The Middleman:</strong> When your PC wants to visit Google, it sends a request to your router. The router goes, “Okay, I’ll go get that for you.” It uses the public IP to get the data back to your PC.</p>

            <p>Because of NAT, you can have 200 devices in your house, but the internet only sees <strong>one</strong> address. Peak human engineering—or a clever hack to keep IPv4 alive!</p>

            <h2>Port Forwarding</h2>
            <p>If you’re new, port forwarding sounds scary. If you’ve been doing DevOps for 10 years, it still scares you.</p>
            <p>Here’s the deal: your router has 1 public IP, but many devices inside with private IPs. When traffic comes to <code>publicIP:port</code>, the router doesn’t know which device to send it to. Port forwarding fixes that: you tell the router, “if anyone comes to port 443, send it to my PC at 192.168.1.10:443.”</p>

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypted data is like shouting an inside joke on the street—everyone sees it going somewhere, but only the friend understands.</li>
                <li>The router keeps a NAT table to track connections, making sure responses go to the right device—like customs checking packages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Well, as you swear about networking being weird… I’m going to sleep. Cya.</p>
